## General Info
This is an example of a dynamic flashcard game. A bigger idea is a website where many different games can be matched up with many different exercises. Teachers could assign exercises to students, and students could choose the game with which they can perform the exercises. This particular game uses the [D3 JavaScript library](https://d3js.org/).
