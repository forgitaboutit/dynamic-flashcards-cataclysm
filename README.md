## General Info
This is an example of a keyboard-based dynamic flashcard game inspired by a software program from the 1980's called [Typing Tutor IV: With Letter Invaders](https://www.amazon.com/Typing-Tutor-IV-Letter-Invaders/dp/067163481X) where strings of characters would fall from the sky and the object was to type them accurately before they hit the ground. A bigger idea is a website where many different such games can be matched up with many different exercise sets. Teachers could assign exercises to students, and students could choose the game to perform the exercises. This particular game uses the [D3 JavaScript library](https://d3js.org/).
